/// GLOBAL PLACEHOLDERS

/// WARNING: Global placeholders are imported early, so if a
/// class selector references them, it puts those selectors at the
/// very top of the compiled css, above normalize and probably before
/// the class selectors intended to be overridden via inheritance

/// This feature of Sass v3 might get fixed in Sass v4
